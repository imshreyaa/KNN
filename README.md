# KNN
K- Nearest Neighbour 
The main aim of this algorithm is to find the best suitable value of "K" , thus we plot the garph of the error rate , such thet the lowest value after which the plot does not go below it would be decided as the value of K

In this case when we used the default value of K from sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier i.e. 5 the accuracy score was 0.72
But, when we set the value of K as 35 the accuracy score increased and became 0.80
